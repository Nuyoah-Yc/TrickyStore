# Tricky Store

A trick of keystore. **Android 12 or above is required**.

## Usage

1. Flash this module and reboot.  
2. Customize target packages at `/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt` (Optional).  
3. (Optional) Override the proxy relay endpoint at `/data/adb/tricky_store/proxy.txt`.  
4. Enjoy!  

**All configuration files will take effect immediately.**

## Proxy-only architecture

This build no longer performs any local certificate hacking or generation, and therefore
**does not use `keybox.xml`**. Every package listed in `target.txt` has its keystore
attestation forwarded to a remote clean device through the proxy relay, which returns a
genuine hardware-backed attestation chain.

- `proxy.txt` — relay base URL. If absent/empty the built-in default endpoint is used.
- `card.txt` — optional billing card key sent with each request.

## Build Vars Spoofing

> **Zygisk (or Zygisk Next) is needed for this feature to work.**

If you still do not pass you can try enabling/disabling Build variable spoofing by creating/deleting the file `/data/adb/tricky_store/spoof_build_vars`.

Tricky Store will automatically generate example config props inside `/data/adb/tricky_store/spoof_build_vars` once created, on next reboot, then you may manually edit your spoof config.

Here is an example of a spoof config:

```
MANUFACTURER=Google
MODEL=Pixel 8 Pro
FINGERPRINT=google/husky_beta/husky:15/AP31.240617.009/12094726:user/release-keys
BRAND=google
PRODUCT=husky_beta
DEVICE=husky
RELEASE=15
ID=AP31.240617.009
INCREMENTAL=12094726
TYPE=user
TAGS=release-keys
SECURITY_PATCH=2024-07-05
```

For Magisk users: if you don't need this feature and zygisk is disabled, please remove or rename the
folder `/data/adb/modules/tricky_store/zygisk` manually.

## Support TEE broken devices

TEE-broken devices are supported out of the box: since attestation is forwarded to a
remote clean device, no working local TEE/StrongBox attestation key is required. Just list
the package in `target.txt`.

For example:

```
# target.txt
io.github.vvb2060.keyattestation
com.google.android.gms
```

Legacy `@` / `!` suffixes are accepted but ignored — every listed package goes through proxy.
